    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My parents recently asked me to install an IP video surveillance camera at their
house (for reasons). Since I already have a Linux server there running 24/7, it
was only natural that I somehow set it up to record the camera&rsquo;s video feed (mp4
over RTSP). After a bit of googling I found <a href="http://www.zoneminder.com/">ZoneMinder</a>, which looked like
it did everything I needed. However, after wasting half a day fiddling with it,
I realized that it is, although very complex and feature-rich, not up to my
needs: no matter how you configure it, it will convert the video feed into
thousands of JPEG files and store them randomly on the filesystem. It also uses
a MySQL database to store its information (so extra dependencies), viewing the
camera live is very slow (refreshes a static image every 4-5 seconds), replaying
a recording needs the Java plug-in in your browser (which I don&rsquo;t have on
Ubuntu) and you have to &ldquo;export&rdquo; a movie clip (i.e. it has to convert all the
images it saved back to a video). What a waste, but I can see how this solution
could be the most compatible with all possible environments (camera types, OSes,
etcetera). I was unable to set up authentication or a maximum total file size,
either.</p>

<p>Being fed up with ZoneMinder, I ditched it and decided to try and hack together
something of my own. After fiddling for the next half of the day with <code>ffmpeg</code>,
I came up with a viable solution, in bash.</p>

<p>``` bash bashsurv.sh <a href="https://gist.github.com/4100939">https://gist.github.com/4100939</a> View Gist</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<p>OUTPUT_DIR=&ldquo;/var/www/bashsurv&rdquo;
FFMPEG_INPUT_FLAGS=&ldquo;-rtsp_transport udp&rdquo;
FFMPEG_SOURCE=&ldquo;rtsp://192.168.1.123/video.mp4&rdquo;
FFMPEG_OUTPUT_FLAGS=&ldquo;-r 20 -acodec libspeex&rdquo;
FFMPEG_OUTPUT_EXT=&ldquo;ogv&rdquo;
CLIP_LENGTH=60 # seconds
KEEP_FILES_FOR=5 # minutes</p>

<p>while [ true ]; do
  ffmpeg -t $CLIP_LENGTH $FFMPEG_INPUT_FLAGS -i $FFMPEG_SOURCE \</p>

<pre><code>$FFMPEG_OUTPUT_FLAGS $OUTPUT_DIR/$(date +%F.%T).$FFMPEG_OUTPUT_EXT
</code></pre>

<p>  find $OUTPUT_DIR/ -type f -mmin +$KEEP_FILES_FOR -delete
done
```</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to just copy the codec, which would have been
optimal in terms of resource (CPU/memory) usage on my server, but it doesn&rsquo;t
use up <em>that</em> much. Now I can set <code>OUTPUT_DIR</code> to somewhere in my <code>/var/www</code>,
set up authentication on it via <code>.htaccess</code> and be done with it. Dad can now
easily view the recordings using his browser, and if he really needs to view the
live stream I can just bookmark the RTSP stream in VLC for him or something.</p>

<p>Bottom line: K.I.S.S.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the tutorial on how to successfully fuck up with <code>find</code>, the command line tool. In case you&rsquo;re not familiar with the <code>find</code> command, <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/find">RTFM</a>, it&rsquo;s freaking beautiful. However, in the hands of a non-RTFM-ing user (like me) it can be quite destructive. Let me demonstrate.</p>

<p>I wanted to use <code>find</code> to delete a bunch of files from a hierarchy, based on a simple name rule. So I thought I should use <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/xargs"><code>xargs</code></a> in combination with <code>find</code> to delete them. After a quick lookup of the <code>-print0</code> and <code>-name</code> arguments of the <code>find</code> command, I concluded that it would be a good idea to run the following command:</p>

<p><code>console
$ find . -print0 -name example | xargs -0 rm
</code></p>

<p>Can you guess what it did? Let me help you: it deleted all the files under <code>.</code>. The directories are still there, but they&rsquo;re not any help, are they? Now, fortunately for me, this was in a git repository that I had just pushed to a remote, so I was able to just clone it again.</p>

<p>In order to understand what happened, I had to actually read the man page carefully and pay attention. Apparently, everything that comes after the path (in my case <code>.</code>) on the command line is treated as an expression by <code>find</code>, where every argument evaluates to true or false, and is ORed with the next one. The <code>-print0</code> argument always returns true, because it&rsquo;s only meant to change the output, not the actual filtering. Because of this, my <code>-name</code> argument was completely ignored.</p>

<p>To conclude, the correct command would have been:</p>

<p><code>console
$ find . -name example -print0 | xargs -0 rm
</code></p>

<p>This way, the <code>-name</code> argument will take precedence over <code>print0</code>. However, because I actually spent time reading the manual this time, I discovered <code>find</code> also has a <code>-delete</code> argument, so <code>xargs</code> is not actually needed at all:</p>

<p><code>console
$ find . -name example -delete
</code></p>

<p>As I was saying, freaking beautiful.</p>
